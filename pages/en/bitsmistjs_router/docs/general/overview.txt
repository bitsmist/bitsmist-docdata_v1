====== Overview ======

===== Introduction =====

The BitsmistJS Router is an addon library for BitsmistJS that handles routings. It can do specific jobs for each route, such as adding extra components for the current URL. 

By importing the library, you can use the "<bm-router>" tag, and putting it on the HTML makes the router working. 

The router can load additional settings for each route. A file containing additional settings is called a spec file. Specifying settings in the spec file makes an application do some extra jobs depending on the route.

The router also handles the popstate event. When the event is triggered, the router calls the open() method to process as the usual loading process.

===== Installation =====
