''Inherit:Organizer''

=====Overview=====

LoaderOrganizer handles loading component files that need to be autoloaded. It starts loading files for the page when DOMs are loaded. If the organizer is attached to a component, it starts loading files inside its own inner HTML after the HTML is appended to a node.

=====Organizing=====

At the organizing stage, it loads files for tags that need to be loaded from the net when the component's inner HTML is attached.
