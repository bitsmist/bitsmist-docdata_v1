''Inherit:Organizer''

=====Overview=====

SettingOrganizer manages basic settings such as the component's name and path. SettingOrganizer is called before any other organizers are called.

At the organizing stage, it loads settings passed via parameters and stores them as component settings. It also loads settings from an external setting file if specified, and load settings from tag attribute if exists.
